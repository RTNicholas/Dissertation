See you there
There is a dog on the floor
My cat is blue
I like coffee
I do not like tea
The black cat and the black dog
Red sun and white moon
the cat in the hat
for the day
now now have no fear
with a cup and a cake
the milk and the cake
from up there on the ball
now look at this house
million this year and
million in to a total of
my wife
welcome here
good night
good morning
i do not eat that
